This program will accept the WebNMS/html directory as the argument and
convert all the "*.properties" to "*_en_us.properties"  files with
"$<<" and ">>$" delimeter.


Using this we can test how much we have internationalized.

non-internationalized word will not have "$<<" and ">>$" delimeter. Using
this delimeter we can easily identifed non-internationalized words.
