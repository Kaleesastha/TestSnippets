Tem,
When we discover a node through RTA’s node discovery option, the MO is set with “public” as the write community. The one we configured in the seed file is “private” which is not set in the ManagedObject (that we receive in the discovery filter).
I have tried our latest patch which doesn’t fix this issue.   This is been reported from our production server and we need a fix ASAP.
