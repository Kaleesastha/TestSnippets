  This file is used to configure data collection for the devices discovered
  by Web NMS.  Changes done to this file dynamically will not be considered
  that is to say that the changed done during the run time or during a warm
  start (starting the Web NMS server without reinitializing) will not be 
  considered.  This file is read by the Polling engine only in cold start, 
  i.e., when Web NMS is started after reinitializing.  Before editing this 
  file please read the help documentation and look at examplePolling.conf 
  which gives the full details of what all can be done and how it should be 
  done. Remember the examplePolling.conf file is not read by the Web NMS
  server, it just serves as example as to how configuration can be done.
  Only this file is read by the server.
