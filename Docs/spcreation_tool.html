<br><a NAME="Introduction"></a><b><font size=+1>Introduction</font></b>
<p>The Service Pack Creation tool (SPC) is used to create Service Pack
(SP) files, which are packaged as product updates. The created SP file
has a
<b>.ppm</b> extension and is created under the <i>&lt;SPC tool Home></i>
directory. The tool accepts two different versions of product zips (e.g.
JSR 1.0. zip and JSR 1.1.zip) and creates the .ppm (or SP) file. The created
SP or PPM comprises only the modified files, which are extracted from the
two product zips. It must be ensured that one product zip is of an older
version than the other.
<blockquote><a NAME="package"></a><b>Package Structure of the Tool</b>
<p>The package structure of the tool is as follows:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; |
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; bin
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
|_createSP.bat/sh
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; conf

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; |_AdventNetCCLLoader.jar,
crimson.jar, jaxp.jar, PatchCreation.jar, SPCreation.jar, xalan.jar
<p><a NAME="Preamble"></a><b>The Preamble for Running the Tool</b>
<ul>
<li>
You need to ensure that the mandatory file namely <b>update_conf.xml
</b>is
available in the "&lt;<i>Product Home>/conf</i>" directory of both the
product zips. These product zips are given as inputs to the SPC tool. This
file is read by the tool for,</li>

<ul>
<li>
Verifying the compatibility of the two product zips. It is verified whether
both the product zips are of BE or FE or Client context. You cannot provide
one FEzip and another BE zip as inputs to the tool.</li>
</ul>

<li>
If you want to package files other than those extracted from the product
zips then you need to create a "<b>Resources</b>" directory under <i>&lt;SPC
tool Home></i> directory for storing these files.</li>

<li>
<font color="#000000">The <b>README </b>file<b> </b>is mandatory for creating
the SP or the PPM. The absolute path of location of the file must be specified
for the "SPReadMe" property in the CreateSP.xml file.</font></li>

<li>
<font color="#000000">Please ensure that you do not place files to be packaged
for the SP inside the &lt;Product Home>/<b>Patch </b>directory. This is
because, the tool <b>does not</b> package the files of the "Patch" directory
into the SP or PPM.</font></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<blockquote><a NAME="Usages"></a><b>Usages and Options of the Tool</b>
<p>Besides creating SPs or PPMs, the tool can be used for several other
options as given below:
<br>&nbsp;
<table BORDER COLS=2 WIDTH="100%" >
<tr>
<td>
<center><b>&nbsp;Command&nbsp;</b></center>
</td>

<td>
<center><b>Description&nbsp;</b></center>
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>createSP.bat -l OldZip NewZip&nbsp;</td>

<td>It is to retrieve the list of modified or/and added files contained
in both the product zips(given as inputs to the tool). The explanation
of the arguments are,
<br><b>-l</b>: It is the switch to list the modified or/and added files
<br><b>OldZip</b>: It is the base product zip (mostly the SP is appled
over it e.g.&nbsp; "JSR_1_0.zip").&nbsp;
<br><b>NewZip</b>: It is the latest product zip containing the customizations
performed over the base product e.g."JSR_1_0.zip"&nbsp;
<p>Example Command:&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<b>createSP.bat - l&nbsp; JSR_1_0.zip&nbsp; JSR_1_1.zip</b>
<p><b>Note</b>: You can maintain copy of the modified files in any file
e.g. <b>a.txt</b>. The a.txt file is created inside the <i>&lt;SPC tool
Home>/bin </i>directory with all the modified files. The command must be
as,
<center><b>SP.bat -l OldZip NewZip >a.txt</b></center>
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>createSP.bat -c OldZip NewZip ConfFile</td>

<td>It is to create the SP or the PPM.. The SP or the PPM is created based

</blockquote>
<a NAME="Description"></a><b><font size=+1>Description of Configurable
Files</font></b>
<p>The two main configurable files of the SPC tool are Input.xml and CreateSP.xml.
The details of these files are as follows:
<ul>
<li>
<font size=+1><b>CreateSP.xml</b>:</font> This configuration file (located
in <i>&lt;SPC tool Home>/conf</i> directory) is used by the SPC tool for
extracting the modified files from the two zipped products which are provided
as inputs to the tool. The various configurable options (i.e., XML definitions)
provided in this file enables you to choose or reject the files which you
want or don't want to be packaged into the SP. All the XML definitions
of this file are as explained here:</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<ul>
<li>
<b>&lt;createsp></b>: This is the root mandatory XML tag of the file. All
other tags must be specified inside it.</li>

<li>
<b>&lt;properties></b>: This is the main XML tag used for specifying the
various properties, which are mandatory for file extraction. The "<b>name</b>"
of the property cannot be modified whereas the "<b>value</b>" can be modified.
The definitions of the properties are as follows:</li>
</ul>

<ul>&nbsp;
<table BORDER >
<tr>
<td><b>SPDir</b></td>

<td>This is a mandatory property, which represents the folder (or directory)
that stores the extracted files of the product zip (i.e., NewZip). You
can specify any desired folder name for this property. For example, you
can have a folder namely "MyDir" as value for this property, which is as
shown here;
<p>&nbsp; &lt;property name="SPDir" value="<b>MyDir</b>"/>
<p>This folder (or directory) is created under the &lt;SPC Tool Home> directory.
By default, the folder "SPDir" is created inside the &lt;SPC Tool Home>
directory.&nbsp;</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><b>RelativeProductHome</b></td>

<td>This is a mandatory property, which accepts the home path of the zipped
products, which are input to the tool. The home path of both the input
zipped products must be same. For example, if your input zipped products
are "AdvenNet_4_0_2.zip" and "AdvenNet_4_1.zip" and they both comprise
a package structure as "AdventNet/WebNMS/&lt;all other directories>", then
their home path is "AdventNet/WebNMS". The value specified for this property
is as shown here,
<p>&nbsp; &lt;property name="RelativeProductHome" value="<b>AdventNet/WebNMS</b>"/>
<p>The relative product home is required as reference for the tool to locate
and read the "update_coThe files located in this directory are packaged
in the SP or PPM in the same structure as available here.&nbsp;
<p>For example, assume you want to package a file namely "Sample.class"
of directory structure "com/nms/test". You must then create a resource
folder, e.g.,"MyResourceDir" inside &lt;SPC tool Home>, and place the file
i.e. <b>com/nms/test/Sample.class</b> into this folder. Enter the value
for this property as shown here,&nbsp;
<p><font color="#000000">&nbsp;&lt;property name="ResourceDir" value="<b>MyResourceDir</b>"/></font>
<p><font color="#000000">As per the above entry the folder, i.e., <b>MyResourceDir
</b>is
created under the &lt;SPC tool Home> directory and the files under it are
packaged in the same directory structure i.e. com/nms/test/Sample.class
into the SP or the PPM. The packaging of files located in this directory&nbsp;
takes precedence over those located in the "SPDir". </font>nf.xml" file
for further extraction of other files. The extracted files are placed inside
the "SPDir" directory.&nbsp;</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><b>ResourceDir</b></td>

<td>This is an optional property, which represents the folder (or directory),
in which you can place any file (other than those extracted from the product
zips) that is to be packaged in the SP or the PPM.&nbsp;</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><b>SPReadMe</b></td>

<td>This is a mandatory property, which indicates the path of location
of the SP readme file. For example, if you have a "MyReadMe.html" in your
"<b>C:/winnt/temp</b>" directory, then specify the same path as value for
this parameter, as shown below:&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp; &lt;property name="SPReadMe" value="<b>C:/winnt/temp/MyReadMe.html</b>"/>
<p>The MyReadMe.html file is copied from the given location to the "SPDir"
(located under &lt;SPC tool Home>) for packaging it into the SP or the
PPM.&nbsp;</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><b>InputXML</b></td>

<td>This is a mandatory property, which is used to indicate the path of
location of the Input.xml file. By default, the Input.xml file is located
in the &lt;SPC tool Home>/conf directory. But, if the Input.xml file is
in a different location, then you must specify its&nbsp; path of location
for this property. For example, if the file is located in your "<b>C:/Temp</b>"
directory then you need to specify the value for this property as shown
below:&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;property name="InputXML"
value="<b>C:/Temp/Input.xml</b>"/>
<p>The Input.xml file is used for creating the SP or the PPM. More details
about this file is given below.&nbsp;</td>

</ul>

<ul>
<li>
<b>&lt;filter></b>: This is the filtering XML tag inside which the filtering
properties and criteria are specified. The definitions of these filtering
properties are given below:</li>

<ul>
<li>
<b>id</b>: This attribute is used to identify the filter based on whose
criteria files are extracted from the product zips. The two types of filters
are,</li>
</ul>

<ul>&nbsp;
<table BORDER WIDTH="100%" >
<tr>
<td><b>UpdateJarFilter</b></td>

<td>This filter is used to segregate the JARs, which are to be packaged
with an extension as ".ujar" (i.e.,as&nbsp; updatejar). This means, only
the updated files (i.e., modified and added files) of these JARs are to
be packaged into the SP or the PPM. As per the entry of this filtering
property, the tool segregates the JARs to be packaged as "ujar" while extracting
them from the product zips. You must specify the complete path of location
of the JAR (in the product) for this property.&nbsp;
<p>The advantage of ".ujar"s is to prevent packaging a complete JAR (in
an SP or PPM) when its being updated by just a single file. This is conducive
in reducing the packaging size of the created SP or PPM.&nbsp;
<p>For example, assume you have added two new files namely Test1.class
and Test2.class into a JAR namely "ZAP.jar" (located in &lt;Product Home>/clases
directory). To package this ZAP.jar as "ujar" specify the entry for the
property as shown here,&nbsp;
<p>&lt;filter id="UpdateJarFilter"&nbsp; classname="com.adventnet.tools.update.util.EnhancedFileFilter">&nbsp;
<br>&lt;criterion key="<b>classes/ZAP.jar</b>" action="ACCEPT"/>&nbsp;
<br>&lt;/filter>&nbsp;
<p>As per the above entry, the "ZAP.jar" is extracted into the "SPDir"
as "<b>ZAP.ujar</b>". This jar contains only the newly added ".class" files,
i.e., Test1.class and Test2.class.The ZAP.jar is packaged with only these
two added files, which gets applied on the product during SP or PPM installation.&nbsp;</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><b>GenericFilter</b></td>

<td>This filter is used to segregate files (of the SPDir), which are not
to be packaged into the SP or the PPM. This property is handy when you
<b>do
not</b> want to package all the files extracted into the "SPDir".
<p>For example, if you do not want to package the "tutorials" and "adventnet_specifications"
files extracted from the product zip into SPDir, then specify them for
this filter as shown here,
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;filter id="GenericFilter" classname="com.adventnet.tools.update.util.EnhancedFileFilter">
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;criterion key="<b>tutorials/*</b>"
action="REJECT"/>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;criterion
key="<b>adventnet_specification/*</b>" action="REJECT"/>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;/filter>
<p><b>Note</b>: The "<b>/*</b>" after every specified directory for the
"criterion" tag means, that all the files of the directory must be rejected
for packaging.&nbsp;</td>

</ul>

<li>
<b>classname</b>: This attribute specifies the name of the class, which
is invoked for the specific filter type.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<ul>
<li>
<b>&lt;criterion></b>: This XML tag is used for setting the criteria for
the filters. It comprises two attributes namely "key" and "action", whose
descriptions are given below:</li>
</ul>

<table BORDER WIDTH="100%" >
<tr>
<td><b>key</b></td>

<td>This attribute is to indicate files or folders (along with their complete
path of location), which are to be filtered based on the filter type i.e,.
Generic or UpdateJar filter.For example, if you <b>do not</b> want to package
an "XYZ.jar", then the entry for this attribute will be as shown here,&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;filter id="UpdateJarFilter"&nbsp; classname="com.adventnet.tools.update.util.EnhancedFileFilter">&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;criterion key="<b>classes/XYZ.jar</b>" action="REJECT"/>

</tr>

<tr>
<td><b>action</b></td>

<td>This attribute is to indicate the action, which is to be performed
on the files or folders specified for the "key" attribute.Generally, this
attribute holds either of the two action types, viz., ACCEPT and REJECT.&nbsp;
<p>ACCEPT: This action type indicates acceptance of files or folders (specified
for the "key" attribute), for packaging into the SP or PPM.&nbsp;
<br>REJECT: This action type indicates rejection of files or folders (specified
for the "key" attribute), from being packaged into the SP or the PPM.</td>

<li>
<b><font size=+1>Input.xml</font></b>:&nbsp; This configuration file (located
in<i> &lt;SPC tool Home>/conf </i>directory) is interpreted by the SPC
tool for creating the SP (or PPM). It provides input details such as the
product name, product version, and SP version, which are read and used
by the tool to define the name for the created SP. For example, if an SP
of the following <i>product name- <b>JSR;</b> product version -<b> 4.0</b>;&nbsp;
and SP version - <b>1.0&nbsp;</b></i><b> </b>is to be created then, the
SP filename will be <b>JSR_4_0_SP-1_0.ppm.</b></li>

<p><br>The input parameters namely product name and version (product and
SP) must be specified correctly in this file, as these are verified and
compared with that of the "update_conf.xml" file of the base product during
SP application. If there is a mismatch of the product name or version (either
product or SP), then the SP doesn't get applied on the base product.
<p>The explanation of these mandatory input parameters specified inside
the root node i.e., &lt;patchDetails> of the file are as follows:
<br>&nbsp;
<table BORDER WIDTH="100%" >
<tr>
<td><b>patch Description</b></td>

<td>It is the description of the created SP file for your reference.</td>

</tr>

<tr>
<td><b>productVersion</b></td>

<td>It is the base product version over which the SP or the PPM is to be
