  <title>HardCode SUM port to avoid http request</title>
</head>
<body>
The Smart service pack check with the primary will be performed during
the startup of the standby &amp; the standalone FE.<br>
<br>
The Primary server will write the SUMPORT in the html/SUMPort.html.
When the secondary or standlaone starts it will try to read the file as
http://primaryserver:webserverport/html/SUMPort.html. Since the primary
has no apache in the setup, it cannot read the file &amp; you are
getting the error.<br>
<br>
SOLUTION:<br>
<br>
By setting the SUMPORT as constant , we can avoid this error.<br>
<br>
Changes in Primary BE &amp; Standby BE setup.<br>
1. Open the SmartUpdateManager.xml under the conf directory of NMSHOME.
Fix the server port as follows to avoid the reading of SUMPort.html
under Existing line:<br>
<br>
&lt;UpdateManagerServer Port="" SmartUpdate="true"
DownLoadEnabled="true"<br>
Modify as &lt;UpdateManagerServer Port="1947" SmartUpdate="true"
DownLoadEnabled="true"<br>
<br>
It can be a any free port, based on your environment.<br>
2. The make the similar changes for Client node as follows in the same
file<br>
Existing one: &lt;UpdateManagerClient Host="" Port=""
SmartUpdate="true" SmartRevert="false"<br>
Modify as &lt;UpdateManagerClient Host="" Port="1947"
SmartUpdate="true" SmartRevert="false"<br>
<br>
Chnages in StandloneFE:<br>
Open the SmartUpdateManager.xml under the conf directory of WEBNMSFEHOME<br>
Since you are going to run the standlone FE &amp; BE in the same
machine. Changes need to be done only for the
&lt;UpdateMangerClientHost node<br>
<br>
Existing one:.<br>
&lt;UpdateManagerClient Host="" Port="" SmartUpdate="true"
SmartRevert="false"<br>
Modify as &lt;UpdateManagerClient Host="" Port="1947"
SmartUpdate="true" SmartRevert="false"<br>
<br>
We believe the above configuration will surely avoid the updatemanger
issue in your setup. We could understand your frusteration &amp; pains
in setting up the environment with your proposed model without the
proper documentation for this particular setup. We earnestly apologize
for the inconvenience caused in this regard. We assure you that we will
definitely capture these steps in our documentation for our next
release.<br>
<br>
RMI Conflict:<br>
As Mark suggested you can also remove the serverparameters.conf node
from the DownloadFiles.xml to overcome the RMI Conflict issue. But this
removal should be done after the downloading the conf files atleast
once form the BE. You can very well use the DownloadFiles.xml attached
by Mark earlier in this thread.<br>
<br>
PollUnitProcess:<br>
We could not see such process in the the default NmsProcessesFE.conf of
4.7 installtion. Any how, could you send the logs of the standlone FE
to check for possible error for this process failure.<br>
Please get back to us, if you need further assistance.<br>
Thanks and Regards,<br>

Hello Simone,<br>
<br>
With respect to the PollUnitProcess issue, you have the following entry
at the end of the NmsProcessesFE.conf file that is not present in my
installation. I hope support can shed some light on what it does but<br>
meanwhile you can delete it to get rid of the error: <br>
#java com.adventnet.nms.pollui.PollUnitProcess<br>
PROCESS com.adventnet.nms.pollui.PollUnitProcess<br>
ARGS NULL<br>
<br>
With respect to the Update Manager error, I believe it that this is due
to the random generation of the Update Manager port in the BE not being
available to the FE. You can get around this by including the following
entry in the SERVER_FILES tag of the &lt;FE_home\conf\downloadFiles.xml
file: <br>
&lt;FILEhtml/SUMPort.html &lt;/FILE&gt;<br>
You will need to put downloadEachTime="true" for the SERVER-FILES but
exclude the file serverparameters.conf from the list (as this would
affect the RMI port used by the FE). I attach an example file that has
worked on my installation.<br>
<br>
I ask Support to check the above.<br>
Regards, Mark<br>

Hi Mark, in attachment you can find the requested files.<br>
Anyway I?d like to synthesize the steps of configuration we made today
in order to have this situation:<br>
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
- -- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<br>
1. We commented out the following lines:<br>
On the BE:<br>
#java com.adventnet.nms.startnms.NmsMainFE [NMS_FE_PORT
WebNMSSocketPort] [USE_QUOTES_IN_DATABASE_TABLES true/false] [CLIENT_<br>
#PROCESS com.adventnet.nms.startnms.NmsMainFE<br>
#ARGS CLIENT_SERVER TCP<br>
<br>
2. Ports changes we made on the FE server:<br>
we changed the ports number in order to avoid ports conflict (RMI port,
webserver port etc?) as in the nms-support mail <br>
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
- -- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<br>
<br>
With these configuration steps we succeed in starting all the modules
with no apparent conflict or problems but the PollUnitProcess failure
in the FE standalone instance startup.<br>
<br>
ISSUES:<br>
* We don?t know if the current configuration can create any problem
(i.e. RMI connections FE-BE for failover purposes or some other
functionalities we are not able to foresee). Can you certificate that
it can<br>
work correctly? <br>
* We?d like to disable all of the FE components on the BE Tier still
active: Apache and JSP modules (that now we didn?t commented out as the
supportsaid!!! because if we did it, we obtain an error as the Update
manager cannot be started). How can we solve the problems we?ll get if
we follow this way?<br>

We resolved the problem of the RMI conflict we still have a process
that doesn?t start correctly on the FE. The ?PollUnitProcess? is not
started successfully when the standalone FE is started even though
there is no more RMI conflict. Any hint for this new issue?<br>
Thanks<br>
