Trap Filters could be used in case you need to process or modify the raw Trap
PDU itself before you convert the Trap into an Event. The trap filter, you
write, could function in two ways as explained below.
   1) It could return the SnmpPDU passed to it (after processing and or
modifying the PDU). In this case the important thing to note is that the
returned PDU will pass through the trap parsers, event parsers and event
filters defined if any.
   2) It could even construct an Event object out of the Trap PDU passed to
it and return the Event object. In this case the Event object is directly
added into the persistent storage without passing it through trap parsers.
Anyway they are allowed to pass through event parsers and event filters.

   The Trap Filter class should implement the interface
   com.adventnet.nms.eventdb.TrapFilter.
   Please refer JavaDocs for details.

Using this configuration file you could specify the classname of the trap
filter class that WebNMS should use (with the match criteria to identify the Trap).


The following is an example of how you should define the Trap filters. Please
note that this is not taken into account by the WebNMS server. You need to define your trap filters if any after the comment.


You could define mutilple trap filters with their match criteria for the
enterprise oid, Generic Type and Specific Type of the Trap as defined below
in case of SNMP v1 traps and trapoid in case of SNMP v2 or v2c traps.

Please note that you could even use wildcards here, something like
".1.3.6.1.2.*" for enterprise.


<FILTER
	enterprise=".1.3.6.1.2.1.11"
	GT="2"
	ST="0"
	classname="test.TestTrapFilter" />

<FILTER
	enterprise=".1.3.6.1.2.1.11"
	GT="6"
	ST="23"
	classname="test.CustomPrivateTrapFilter" />

<FILTER
	trapoid=".1.3.6.1.6.3.1.1.5.4"
	classname="test.LinkUpDownTrapFilter" />
