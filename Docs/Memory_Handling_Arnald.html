 target="_blank">Part 1</a></span>,
I discussed about reading and understanding system wide memory usage.
This post is dedicated to describe how to read and understand
application (process or program) specific memory usage, such as Java,
MySQL, memcached etc.<br>
<br>
A typical linux program (assume Java or
MySQL) contains following fixed size segments that require fixed memory
while running. These memory entities are directly accountable to the
process.<br>
<ol>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">text/code</span> - Assembly
Instructions</li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">rodata</span> - Read only data
(constants, string literals, etc)</li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">data</span> - uninitialized
read/write data (global variables, static variables etc)</li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">bss</span> - zero initialized
data</li>
  <li>And some more complex data. You can refer <a
 href="http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/1059" target="_blank">http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/1059</a>
for more info.</li>
</ol>
You can use '<span
 style="font-weight: bold; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">objdump</span>'
to learn more about what is inside an executable file.<br>
<br>
<br>
Most
of the linux programs are linked to dynamic libraries such as LIBC.
Shared libraries will be loaded into memory if it is not loaded by some
other process, otherwise the process will simply share the memory space
to access the library. However, the (read/write) data area will be
unique to each process for obvious reasons. The memory will be marked
as shared memory. The shared memory tracking and accounting
is pretty difficult as it could be shared by more than 1 process.<br>
<br>
You can use '<span
 style="font-weight: bold; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">ldd</span>'
to find various shared libraries liked to an executable file. For run
time analysis use '<span
 style="font-weight: bold; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">/proc/&lt;pid&gt;/maps</span>'
and '<span
 style="font-weight: bold; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">/proc/&lt;pid&gt;/smaps'</span>.<br>
<br>
<br>
The
final and very important memory that an application/program uses is
HEAP. Understanding what is heap memory and how this works is very
important for writing large programs, even if the language (ex: Java)
claims that the programmer need not worry about memory. Lets talk about
it later. Please refer the following link to know more about heap:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a
 href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_memory_allocation"
 target="_blank">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_memory_allocation</a>.<br>
<br>
<br>
Enough introduction, lets see how we can find out memory usage of an
application/process. The '<span
 style="font-weight: bold; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">top</span>'
and '<span
 style="font-weight: bold; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">ps</span>'
are the simple and most commonly used tool to find application memory
usage. The following snapshot presents a sample output of '<span
 style="font-weight: bold; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">top</span>'
command.<br>
<br>
<br>

 style="border: 0px none ;"></span><br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"><br>
VIRT or VSZ:</span><br>
<span></span><br>
Total
amount of virtual memory used by a process including code, data, shared
libraries, swapped out memory and heap. This is not the actual physical
memory used by the process but total virtual address space assigned to
a particular process.<br>
<br>
Remember that allocating virtual memory
doesn't mean that the process gets the memory but it only gets the
address space for the requested size. Upon accessing the virtual memory
the process generates 'Page Faults' and the kernel allocates physical
memory to the process while resolving the 'Page Faults'.<br>
<br>
To know more about this please google for 'Linux Virtual Memory' and
continue to read.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">RES or RSS:</span><br>
<br>
The
resident memory size or the real physical memory that is currently used
by the application. This field give the exact amount of physical memory
used by a particular application.<br>
<br>
From the example above the MySQL process uses 411MB of virtual memory
but only 50MB of physical memory. The reason could be:<span></span>
<ol>
  <li>Part of the physical memory is swapped out due to memory pressure
or stale memory</li>
  <li>The mapped (mmap()) file/data is not accessed by the process yet<br>
  </li>
  <li>The allocated memory (malloc()) is not accessed by the process yet</li>
  <li>Am I missing anything?<br>
  </li>
</ol>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">SHR:</span><br>
<br>
The amount of memory that is being shared between different process.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">%MEM:</span><br>
Percent of total available physical memory assigned to this particular
process.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"><br>
IMPORTANT NOTES:<br>
</span><br>
<ol>
  <li>Having
huge difference between RES/VIRT may not harm the system. However, it
is highly possible that the process might generate huge number of page
faults while trying to map unmapped virtual memory area.</li>
  <li>MySQL
should not have huge difference in RES/VIRT as by design MySQL will not
use malloc() often but use internal cache for its memory requirement.
Having large difference means that the MySQL's various buffers are not
properly configued.</li>
  <li>Java should not have huge difference in RES/VIRT as by design JVM
uses its own Heap manager to provide memory for applications.</li>
  <li>From
(2) and (3) it is clear that the memory usage pattern is based on the
design. So, to validate any design it is important to see the memory
usage along with the functionality.</li>
</ol>
The below link will be useful to analyze the performance of MySQL
running in Linux.<br>

<br>
After 6 months of working with various Zoho services I believe that
one of the main problem that prevents our applications to scale is poor
memory usage/management. This post (and series of other posts) is to
help create awareness about the memory problem across the development
team.<br>
<br>
It
would be great if readers can take active part in building the
knowledge by sharing their experience, problems and also by asking
questions.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span><br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">WHY THIS POST?:</span><br>
<br>
1. Help to understand memory usage/management which is very critical to
develop high performance applications.<br>
2. To demonstrate plenty of memory doesn't automatically mean high
performance - but good program is.<br>
3. Understanding Java GC behaviour and tuning the behaviour is very
crucial to develop scalable applications<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">PLAN:</span><br>
<br>
1. Serious of forum post on various memory related issues, features,
configuration, tuning etc<br>
2. The topics are going to be varied from Linux memory manager to Java
GC<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">NOTES:</span><br>
<br>
1. I can not explain every possible details as it is near
impossible to do so using forum post. But these posts will help you get
start and learn more about the problem, eventually address the problem.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">PART 1 - READING SYSTEM MEMORY USAGE</span><br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span><br>
I
want to start with a very simple topic as this is the first post in the
series. This part explains how to read and understand how much memory
available in the system and how much memory is used and who is using
the memory.<br>
<br>
The basic command that can be used to monitor system
memory usage is 'free'. Of course you can use various other commands
such as 'top', 'sar', '<span><a
 href="https://discussions.zoho.com/intranet?ftid=1000000000226249"
 title="https://discussions.zoho.com/intranet?ftid=1000000000226249"
 target="_blank">vmstat</a></span>', '/proc/meminfo', etc. But for
simplicity let me use 'free' to explain the data, the readers can
explore other commands.<br>
<br>
The following diagram shows typical output from a 'free' command:<br>
<br>
<span></span><span><img
 src="https://discussions.zoho.com/viewFile.do?fileId=1000000000296119&amp;forumGroupId=1000000000002001"
 alt="/viewFile.do?fileId=1000000000296119&amp;forumGroupId=1000000000002001"
 style="border: 0px none ;"><br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">total:</span><br>
This
one is very simple. This tells that how much physical memory (RAM) is
available in the system in KB. This particular system got 32GB of
memory.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">used:</span><br>
This is also fairly simple one. This tells how much memory is being
used by the <span style="font-weight: bold;">system </span>in KB.
Note the word <span style="font-weight: bold;">system</span>, this is
not application - the system includes all process running in the
system, kernel and other subsystems.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">free:</span><br>
Again simpler one, this is the actual physical memory (RAM) available
for allocation in the system.<br>
<br>
<br>
Before going into the next element let me ask you a question. Have you
ever asked yourself that '<span style="font-weight: bold;">my Java heap
is configured as 2GB and my system got 16GB but why the system memory
usage is 99%?</span>'. If so, then you must read the next few
paragraphs.<br>
<br>
In
general, the Linux kernel will try to use as much memory as possible to
make the system robust and efficient. After all memory is a scarce
resource why keep it idle when you can do something better with it.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">buffers:</span><br>
The
buffers are used by the kernel (especially block I/O devices) to keep
the in-transit data while reading/writing from the block devices. In
simpler sense, this memory is used to enhance the disk I/O access time
by accumulating multiple reads and writes (remember DISK I/O is very
costly operation). Usually buffers consumes way less memory than
applications or cache.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">cache:</span><br>
Have
you ever wonder whenever you run grep/find/ls commands on large volume
of file it consumes lots of time? Have you ever noticed whenever you
run the same command second time it is blazingly fast? The answer is
system <span style="font-weight: bold;">'cache</span>'. The kernel
(VFS - Virtual File System) tries to retain the recently opened
files/directories in the memory (cache) expecting that the user/program
may access the same file again. The more you open files (grep on access
files, opening large log file, etc) will be stored in the cache for
future use.<br>
<br>
However, the '<span style="font-weight: bold;">cache</span>' and '<span
 style="font-weight: bold;">buffer</span>' is low priority memory
consumers. Whenever applications asks memory the kernel will grab
memory from '<span style="font-weight: bold;">cache</span>' and '<span
 style="font-weight: bold;">buffer</span>' and returned to user
applications. So you don't really need to worry about that your
application might starve for memory. </span><span>Now you probably
understand why you have less free memory in the system. <br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">SO WHAT IS THE ACTUAL MEMORY USAGE:</span><br>
<br>
Simple maths:<br>
<span><br>
<div class="quote">ACTUAL FREE MEMORY = FREE + CACHE + BUFFER<br>
USED MEMORY = TOTAL MEMORY - ACTUAL FREE MEMORY<br>
</div>
</span></span><span>You can see the values in '<span
 style="font-weight: bold;">-/+ buffers/cache:</span>' line.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">CAN I CONTROL CACHE USAGE:</span><br>
<br>
Yes it is possible by turning kernel parameter '<span
 style="font-weight: bold;">vm.vfs_cache_pressure</span>'. Those who
are interested can try this in your <span style="font-weight: bold;">TEST</span>
setup or you can wait until I publish how to tune this parameter.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"><br>
CAN I FLUSH CACHE:</span><br>
<br>
Yes you can. The kernel let you flush the cache by using '<span
 style="font-weight: bold;">vm.drop_caches</span>'
kernel parameter. However, I wouldn't suggest you to try this unless
you know what you are doing. Cache flush might impact your system
significantly if the system using the cache heavily (for example MySQL).<br>
<br>
<br>
</span><span><span style="font-weight: bold;">PART 3 - JAVA GARBAGE
COLLECTION</span><br>
<br>
For
me, this is one of the most fascinating subject to learn even as a
non-Java programmer for one simple reason - it is complex and
interesting. I am sure you would feel the same way.<br>
<br>
As a hard
core C-programmer I would not call someone else as a proficient
C-programmer if the programmer is not comfortable with complex
C-pointer base programming. And wouldn't consider someone as proficient
Java-programmer if the programmer doesn't understand Java Garbage
Collection and how it works and how it impact the system - though, it
is my personal view.<br>
<br>
It may not be important if the program is
only used by the programmer and perhaps handful of few others. But if
we expect the program to run in high performance cluster and expected
to be used by thousands of people it is better (and important) that the
developers understand the behaviour of the GC. GC is one of the very
important piece of software that is going to run in the system/server
which has huge impact on the overall performance.<br>
<br>
In this post I
will not explain what is GC and how it works. Instead I will point to
some very good links and also list few items you must know if you want
to claim you as GC expert. And also, the upcoming posts are going to be
based on Java GC and it is important to understand the basics of the GC
before heading toward understanding GC related issues.<br>

I
would urge you all (Java developers) spend some time in understanding
the GC behaviour, I am sure this will help you design and develop
memory friendly applications and eventually good scalable applications.
Not understanding will make you keep working on 'Out of memory' errors,
though it is one simple and common cause.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">GC - WHAT YOU SHOULD KNOW:</span><br>
<br>
<ol>
  <li>What is HEAP memory?</li>
  <li>What is Java HEAP memory?</li>
  <li>Heap layout - Eden, Survivor Spaces, Old/Tenured, Perm/Permanent</li>
  <li>Collection Type - Minor and Major</li>
  <li>Collection Modes - Serial, Parallel and Concurrent</li>
  <li>Measuring Performance - Throughput,&nbsp; Pause, Footprint and
Promptness</li>
  <li>Basic configurations <br>
  </li>
</ol>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">IMPORTANT NOTES:</span><br>
<br>
<ol>
  <li>Never ever blame Java GC for application crashes (especially 'Out
of memory' errors). Before you blame GC make sure:</li>
  <ol>
    <li>Debug the program for the root cause - you will never escape by
work around the problem<br>
    </li>
    <li>Monitor and analyze GC behaviour and confirm GC is performing
well</li>
    <li>Tune the GC parameter until you see satisfactory result</li>
    <li>Repeat (1) to (3) as many times as possible</li>
    <li>Time to blame Java GC</li>
  </ol>
  <li>Arbitrarily
increasing/decreasing Java heap size (or any parameter) without
analyzing the result may not yield desired result - most of the time it
makes it even worse! <br>
  </li>
  <li>GC tuning some times consumes more time than total development
time - but it is worth it!</li>
  <li>A typical application need at least 4-12 weeks to tune -
especially with lack of proper test setup</li>
  <li>Never trust google results - do it yourself!</li>
  <li>When
you write 'while' or 'for' loop make sure the loop is well controlled
and throttled. The uncontrolled loop can trigger GC much frequently
than expected and cause system level instabilities.<br>
  </li>
</ol>

experienced by CRM users</a></span>.<br>
<br>
There are few reasons why I did this analysis on this problem:<br>
<ol>
  <li>As part of my effort to create awareness on <span><a

  <li><span>Try to identify what exactly is causing CRM to become slow
and unresponsive</span></li>
  <li><span>Try to understand how worse the user might be feeling - I
am sure it is not pleasant at all<br>
    </span></li>
</ol>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"><br>
HOW I DID:</span><br>
<ol>
  <li>Collected access log file from one of the CRM application server
instance for full run time (start to death)</li>
  <li>Analyzed the log file and collected data on the service response
time<br>
  </li>
  <li>Matched the result from (2) with Zope monitoring tool to make
reasonable prediction on what went wrong</li>
</ol>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">TIMELINE:</span><br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">22/Apr/2009:13:21:39 -0800</span> -
CRM application server restarted<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">23/Apr/2009:12:35:57 -0800</span> -
Server (<span style="font-weight: bold;">within 24hrs</span>) started
behaving abnormal<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">23/Apr/2009:12:58:16 -0800</span> -
Server was killed by SAS monitor due to very high CPU usage<br>
<br>
About
23 minutes the CRM server is in a state of extreme stress for no real
reason - the result is failed to respond to user requests gracefully.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">PART 1 - ACCESS LOG REPORT:</span><br>
<br>
I
ran my small script on the collected access log to find out the HTTP
request/response duration. Please note that I considered URLs that is
accessed more than 3000 times. Here is the report:<br>
<br>
<br>
<span><img
 src="http://discussions.zoho.com/viewFile.do?fileId=1000000000300051&amp;forumGroupId=1000000000002001"
 alt="/viewFile.do?fileId=1000000000300051&amp;forumGroupId=1000000000002001"
 style="border: 0px none ;"></span><br>
<br>
<br>
For simplicity let me use one URL (<span style="font-weight: bold;">/crm/ShowDetails.do</span>)
to explain the problem. From the above statistics:<br>
<ol>
  <li>URL /crm/ShowDetails.do accessed 10274 times over the period of
23hrs</li>
  <li>The average response time is 210ms</li>
  <li>Half of 10274 requests took more than 1535ms to deliver (median).
This is way high than average response time.</li>
  <li>The standard deviation of response time is around 14.5sec - no
way related to average and median values</li>
  <li>The maximum duration recorded is nearly 40sec - Can you imagine
what might be the user thinking?</li>
</ol>
<br>
Now, lets see the duration to deliver /crm/ShowDetails.do during the
entire life time of the application instance.<br>
<br>
<span><img

 style="border: 0px none ;"></span><br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
I
hope now you can visualize how bad the CRM server behaved during the
23minutes just before it was killed. (We should have at least killed
this non performing beast well before).<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">PART 2 - ANALYSIS BASED ON ZOPE
(PREDICT) MONITORING TOOL:</span><br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">NOTE:</span>
The monitoring server's clock is running 3 min 50 sec (3:50) slower
than the CRM server. You need to adjust the time based on it while
looking at this log. We will fix it in the next release :)<br>
<br>
<br>
CRM: <span style="font-weight: bold;"></span><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">23/Apr/2009:12:35:57 -0800</span> - (<span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Zope: 23/Apr/2009:12:32:07 -0800</span>)
Server (<span style="font-weight: bold;">within 24hrs</span>) started
behaving abnormal<br>
CRM: <span style="font-weight: bold;">23/Apr/2009:12:58:16 -0800</span>
- (<span style="font-weight: bold;">Zope: 23/Apr/2009:12:54:24 -0800</span>)
Server was killed by SAS monitor due to very high CPU usage<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Lets start with the CPU usage:<br>
<span><img
 src="http://discussions.zoho.com/viewFile.do?fileId=1000000000300064&amp;forumGroupId=1000000000002001"

 style="border: 0px none ;"></span><br>
<br>
<ul>
  <li>CPU usage suddenly jumped at around&nbsp; <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">23/Apr/2009:12:32:07 -0800 </span>and
remained at high level till get killed</li>
  <li>CRM server got 4 CPU cores - and all of the CPU core's usage is
raised to higher level</li>
  <li>The CPU usage is also predominantly by 'USER' applications</li>
</ul>
<br>
<br>
Lets look at the disk usage and system load:<br>
<span><img

 style="border: 0px none ;"></span><br>
<br>
<ul>
  <li>As expected the system load increased as due to the CPU usage -
this means the system became really busy</li>
  <li>The question is what is it doing? Lets try to answer!</li>
  <li>Have
a look at the disk usage, there is no abnormal behaviour - so we can
rule out any disk related activities (like log file processing, file
compression, etc)</li>
</ul>
<br>
<br>
Then, lets have a look at the network flow:<br>
<br>
<span><img

 style="border: 0px none ;"></span><br>
<br>
<br>
<ul>
  <li>Until the server became busy the network flow is fine</li>
  <li>Then
the flow of packets (incoming and outgoing) became low - it is most
probably due to the fact that the server busy doing something and not
getting enough time to process the incoming/outgoing packets</li>
  <li>This answers why the user experiencing slow - right?</li>
  <li>Have a look at the TCP established sockets - It kept on going
high without any change in the rate of incoming connections.</li>
  <li>The
reason is simple - the system could not serve the existing TCP (HTTP)
connections hence the number of outstanding TCP (HTTP) connections kept
increasing</li>
</ul>
<br>
More TCP details:<br>
<span><img
 src="http://discussions.zoho.com/viewFile.do?fileId=1000000000300078&amp;forumGroupId=1000000000002001"
 alt="/viewFile.do?fileId=1000000000300078&amp;forumGroupId=1000000000002001"
 style="border: 0px none ;"></span><br>
<br>
<ul>
  <li>Each TCP socket (connection) will have two buffers, one for
sending and other for receiving</li>
  <li>In the above figure both incoming and outgoing socket's receive
buffer contains in-transit data</li>
  <li>This proves that the application is not even reading the data
which is available</li>
</ul>
<br>
Lets go one more step deep into TCP:<br>
<span><img
 src="http://discussions.zoho.com/viewFile.do?fileId=1000000000300080&amp;forumGroupId=1000000000002001"
 alt="/viewFile.do?fileId=1000000000300080&amp;forumGroupId=1000000000002001"
 style="border: 0px none ;"></span><br>
<br>
<ul>
  <li>Each
TCP listener socket will have a special queue called TCP backlog (or
listen queue) where all the incoming connections are moved once
completing the TCP 3-way handshake</li>
  <li>The queue will be cleared upon calling accept() from application</li>
  <li>It is clear that the backlog queue is getting filled with
outstanding incoming TCP connections</li>
  <li>Which means application can't even accept the new incoming
connections.<br>
  </li>
</ul>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Hope you understand how the simple CPU
usage spike makes the end-to-end behaviour so bad.</span><br>
<br>
<br>
So,
the application is not doing disk intensive operation and also there is
no network flow. What exactly the application is doing? Can't predict
now, lets see the next data - context switch and interrupts.<br>
<br>
<span><img
 src="http://discussions.zoho.com/viewFile.do?fileId=1000000000300082&amp;forumGroupId=1000000000002001"
 alt="/viewFile.do?fileId=1000000000300082&amp;forumGroupId=1000000000002001"
 style="border: 0px none ;"></span><br>
<br>
<ul>
  <li>Low disk usage and low network usage - low interrupt proves that
clearly</li>
  <li>Interestingly
very high context switch - this clearly shows us that the application
server is really busy doing something that triggers huge number of
context switch between threads/processes</li>
  <li>Question - what is it doing? Can't answer yet!</li>
</ul>
<br>
<br>
Lets look at the process queue:<br>
<br>
<span><img
 src="http://discussions.zoho.com/viewFile.do?fileId=1000000000300084&amp;forumGroupId=1000000000002001"

 style="border: 0px none ;"></span><br>
<br>
<br>
<ul>
  <li>As expected the RUN QUEUE has too many processes - just to
confirm how busy CRM server is</li>
  <li>12:32 - 12:36 - not much processes created - just to prove we are
not taking any new connections<br>
  </li>
</ul>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">SO FAR...</span><br>
<br>
<ul>
  <li>We proved that the applications servers (Java) suddenly started
using CPU heavily</li>
  <li>This makes the entire server unresponsive and totally useless</li>
  <li>The CPU is not used for Disk activity</li>
  <li>The CPU is not used to handle network traffic</li>
  <li>Due
to lack of network activity we can easily rule out that we are not
dealing with large data set - Can we rule out MySQL or DB layer? I
guess yes!</li>
  <li>So what is Java doing?</li>
</ul>
<br>
Lets look at one final precious information to guess what Java is busy
doing:<br>
<br>
<span><img
 src="http://discussions.zoho.com/viewFile.do?fileId=1000000000300086&amp;forumGroupId=1000000000002001"

 style="border: 0px none ;"></span><br>
<br>
<br>
<ul>
  <li>The server page fault values are oscillating between 8K to 0 <br>
  </li>
  <li>Around 12:32 The server's page faults remain at high level for
few minutes</li>
  <li>Later the page fault behaviour is not consistent and occasionally
goes very high (10K+)</li>
  <li>It proves that the server is doing some operation which is very
memory intensive</li>
</ul>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">WHAT IS MEMORY INTENSIVE?</span><br>
<br>
I can think of two possibilities:<br>
<ol>
  <li>Heavy Data Processing</li>
  <li>Java Garbage Collector</li>
</ol>
Let me first rule out 'Heavy Data Processing':<br>
<ol>
  <li>If a particular connection triggered this then it should not
overload all CPU cores</li>
  <li>There is no network data flow - reason to rule out high data to
process</li>
  <li>No Deflate on log file is running - I believe it is not
configured (CRM team can you verify?)<br>
  </li>
</ol>
Why I believe it is due to Java Garbage Collector?<br>
<ol>
  <li>The
Java garbage collector (Parallel and Concurrent) is designed to run on
multiple cores - that answer why all CPU cores are over loaded</li>
  <li>Of course it will be memory intensive - that answer why huge page
faults</li>
  <li>From the thread dump - all GC threads and 'Low Memory Detector'
thread is active</li>
</ol>
However, since CRM doesn't enable Java GC logs we have no further data
to analyze.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">CONCLUSION:</span><br>
<br>
<ol>
  <li>CRM
applications possibly leaking too much memory that exhausts Java heap
faster - that results Java GC to monopolize the CPU to try to cleanup
memory</li>
  <li>CRM application yet to study and tune Java GC (<span><a

</ol>
I
believe this conclusion is reasonable and hope this helps CRM team to
fix their problem soon and make their application robust.<br>
<br>
Finally,
this problem is not specific to CRM alone. It is the common behaviour
across Zoho services. I did this study on CRM because of the user post.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span><br>
<div class="quote">Really an eye opener.&nbsp; Memory operation in most
of the services is long
due.&nbsp; This post will definitely help us re-prioritize things.<br>
<br>
Excellent analysis.&nbsp; I really like the way it is presented.<br>
<br>

</div>
<br>
</span>I
believe that we don't even need to re-prioritize things, but the will
to do it. IMHO, understanding the memory usage pattern of each and
every application needs little time and effort than solving other
problems. I estimate that each team will need to spend 1 man hour per
day for 4-8 weeks. This is how I want every team to work:<br>
<br>
<ol>
  <li>Assign a person to monitor memory usage (as I said max 1 hour per
day)</li>
  <li>Enable
GC logging (-verbose:gc -XX:+PrintGCDetails -XX:+PrintGCTimeStamps) in
one of your application server instance (if possible to it in all
servers)<br>
  </li>
  <li>Monitor the GC log every day and find out the answer for:</li>
  <ol>
    <li>How frequently minor GC collection runs? (ex: 10/hour)<br>
    </li>
    <li>How frequently major GC collection runs? (ex: 2/day)<br>
    </li>
    <li>What is the rate of memory consumption? (ex: 512MB/min)</li>
    <li>How fast the application reaches full heap since it started?
(ex: 24hrs)</li>
    <li>How fast the Young Generation reaches full? (ex: 1min)</li>
    <li>How frequently application is restarted/killed? (ex: every 2
days)</li>
  </ol>
  <li>Once we have these basic data we can start tuning GC if necessary
and redo the step (3)</li>
  <li>What is the peak time? What is the peak rate of connection? -
Behaviour of an application during peak time if any?<br>
  </li>
  <li>If there is abnormal behaviour inform the module owner(s) or team
member</li>
</ol>
<br>
This
is based on my understanding there might be some more work we may need
to do. But the bottom line is it doesn't take much effort but the will
to do it.<br>
<br>
I can help any team at any time if needed.<br>
