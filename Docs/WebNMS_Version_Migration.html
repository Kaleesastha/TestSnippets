Ticket Title : WebNMS new version upgrade and migration?<br>
<br>
Dear Reddy<br>
<br>
You can make use of the <a
 href="http://www.adventnet.com/products/webnms/maintenance_and_support_tools.html">Web
NMS Maintenance and Support Tools</a> to migrate the configuration
files.<br>
<br>
In case of database migration, you can take the backup of the data in
the previous version &amp; restore the same in 4.7 SP2<br>
(<b>If the EMS version is based on a version less that 4.7 namely 4.5
or 4.0, kindly tell us the existing WebNMS version he is using</b>. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">We will instruct you accordingly</span>)<br>
Refer the <a
 href="http://www.adventnet.com/products/webnms/help/developer_guide/backup/backupservice.html">WebNMS
Developer guide</a> for more options in this case.<br>

If
there are any DatabaseSchema changes between the EMS versions, the
older data has to be migrated into the new format in the new
DatabaseSchema. For this to be done, the implementation has to be
written and invoked in the pre/post-script process of the UpdateManager
tool, while applying the ".ppm".&nbsp; The following methodology is
suggested to achieve the needs:</font><br style="font-family: tahoma;">
<ul style="font-family: tahoma;">
  <li><font size="-1">A new database has to be created with the changed
DatabaseSchema.</font> </li>
  <li><font size="-1">Once created, all the information present in the
existing database has to be copied to the new one.</font>
  </li>
  <li><font size="-1">Once this is done, Web NMS can use this new
database to get started.</font> </li>
</ul>
<font style="font-family: tahoma;" size="-1">The advantage is that the
collected data is secure and the previous version of Web NMS can be run
anytime.<br>
<br>
The implementation should take care of the following while copying down
the data into the new database.</font><br style="font-family: tahoma;">
<ul style="font-family: tahoma;">
  <li><font size="-1">The newly created database has to be clean
without any data.</font> </li>
  <li><font size="-1">When a table is not present in the new version
and present in the deployed version, then the data in the deployed
version has to be inserted into another table in the new version.</font>
  </li>
  <li><font size="-1">When a table is present in both the new and
the deployed versions, then the data present in the deployed version
has to be read and populated in the new version.</font></li>
</ul>

Hi,<br>
How do your customers do migration to newer versions?<br>
I have a customer who runs on an older version. Now he wants to migrate
to new version which is based on WebNMS 4.7 SP2.<br>
Is there any migration tool, that I can use, which will do DB migration
and conf file migration?<br>
<br>
Thanks,<br>
Reddy
