<p><b><font size=+2>What is Database Checker?</font></b><b></b>
<p>Database Checker is a read only tool, which can be run as a stand-alone
application on WebNMS database, to&nbsp; check data consistency and integrity.
This tool has been integrated into the database query tool (UItoDB), making
it much more useful and powerful.
<p><b><font size=+2>Motivation</font></b><b></b>
<p>As Sridhar Vembu said, <b><i>"Data is everything. Therefore, Data is
God"</i></b>. WebNMS is database centric and the integrity of database
should be maintained all the time without exception. This tool is a first
step in that direction. The tool checks data integrity by ensuring that
various pieces of related data are consistent. For example, the status
of the Managed Object should be the same as the severity level of the most
recent Alert. Similarly, the status of the parent object should be consistent
with the status of the children objects.
<p><b><font size=+2>Checks Performed</font></b>
<p>Currently, this tool performs four major checks :
<br>&nbsp; 1. Checks if the status of parent nodes are consistent with
that of the interfaces.
<br>&nbsp; 2. Checks if the status of the Managed Object is consistent
with the Alert Status.
<br>&nbsp; 3. Checks if the Alert Status is consistent with the most recent
Event generated for the same entity.
<br>&nbsp; 4. Checks if any successive duplicate events are generated for
the same entity.
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b><font size=+2>How do you Invoke the tool?</font></b>
<p>The directory structure is self explanatory. The tool can be invoked
by calling the run.bat script. <b><i>Please ensure that the command "java"
is in the path.</i></b>
<p><b><font size=+2>How do you Customize the tool?</font></b>
<p>The source code is available in the src directory. All the checks are
performed in the file ConsistencyChecker.java. In this class, there is
a method called <b>customCheck()</b>, which is empty. This method can be
used to fill in customized data integrity checks. To compile, use the compile.bat
script. <b><i>Please ensure that the command "javac" is in the path.</i></b>
