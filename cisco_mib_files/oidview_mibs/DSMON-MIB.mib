            The agent MUST NOT lower this value during system operation,
            and SHOULD set this object to an appropriate value during
            system initialization."

dsmonAggControlLocked OBJECT-TYPE
    SYNTAX      TruthValue
    MAX-ACCESS  read-write
    STATUS      current
    DESCRIPTION
            "Controls the setup of aggregation groups for this agent.

            If this object contains the value 'true', then write access
            to the objects in the dsmonAggControlTable,
            dsmonAggProfileTable, and dsmonAggGroupTable is not
            permitted, and data collection is possible.  This object
            only controls write access to these MIB objects. The DSMON
            data collection control tables (e.g., dsmonHostControlTable)
            can be configured at any time, even if data collection
            itself is disabled by this object.

            If this object contains the value 'false', write access to
            the objects in the dsmonAggControlTable,
            dsmonAggProfileTable, and dsmonAggGroupTable is permitted,
            and data collection is not possible.  In addition, all
            objects in all DSMON data tables (e.g., dsmonStatsTable)
            shall be deleted.

            An agent is not required to process SNMP Set Requests for
            this object in conjunction with other objects from this MIB.
            This is intended to simplify the processing of Set Requests
            for tables such as the dsmonAggProfileTable, by eliminating
            the possibility that a single Set PDU will contain multiple
            varbinds which are in conflict, such as a PDU which both
            modifies the dsmonAggProfileTable and locks the
            dsmonAggProfileTable at the same time.

            Note that the agent is not required to validate the entire
            aggregation configuration when an attempt is made to
            transition an instance of this object from 'true' to
            'false'. That validation is done if and when a DSMON data
            collection is activated.

            An agent is required to reactivate any suspended data
            collections when this object transitions to 'true', Each
            active data control entry (e.g., dsmonStatsControlEntry),
            will be validated with respect to the new aggregation
            configuration. If the aggregation profile referenced in the
            data collection is valid, then that collection will be
            restarted. Otherwise, the RowStatus object (e.g.,
            dsmonStatsControlStatus) will be set to 'notReady' for that
            collection control entry."

            A management application SHOULD create an aggregation
            profile by first creating and activating an entry in this
