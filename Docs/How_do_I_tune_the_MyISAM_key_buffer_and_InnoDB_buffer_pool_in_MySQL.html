<h1 style="margin-bottom: 15px;">How do I tune the MyISAM key
buffer and InnoDB buffer pool in MySQL?</h1>
<div class="article_content">
<p>The most important memory component for MySQL performance
tuning are the buffer pools. Any data being accessed on disk, first has
to be loaded into the buffer pools for users to access it. Therefore,
it's the primary focus of database optimization. By default, MySQL will
only use 8MB for MyISAM's key buffer and 8MB for InnoDB's buffer pool.
Therefore, databases of any significant size will need these
configurations tuned. The upper limit is determined in part by your
operating system process limits, and how much memory is available with
your system's hardware.</p>
<h3>InnoDB Buffer Pool</h3>
<p>The InnoDB storage engine has a buffer pool that caches
requests to indexes and data files on disk. It will pre-allocate its
buffer pool when MySQL is started. It won't use more memory than is
allocated. This can be set in the option or configuration file (i.e., <tt>my.cnf</tt>
or <tt>my.ini</tt>, depending on your system) for MySQL as:<br>
</p>
<pre>[mysqld]<br>set-variable = innodb_buffer_pool_size = 512M<br>...<br>      </pre>
<p>If a system is being configured to run solely as a database
server using the InnoDB storage engine, this configuration could be set
up to 80% of total system memory for the best effect.</p>
<p>To examine the performance of an InnoDB buffer pool, use the <tt>SHOW</tt>
statement like so:<br>
</p>
<pre>SHOW INNODB STATUS;<br>      </pre>
<p>Below is an except from the results of this statement:<br>
</p>
<pre>----------------------<br>BUFFER POOL AND MEMORY<br>----------------------<br>Total memory allocated 571450402; in additional pool allocated 171904<br>Buffer pool size   32000<br>Free buffers       29034<br>Database pages     2965<br>Modified db pages  0<br>Pending reads 0<br>Pending writes: LRU 0, flush list 0, single page 0<br>Pages read 64, created 2901, written 3855<br>0.00 reads/s, 39.00 creates/s, 119.07 writes/s<br>Buffer pool hit rate 1000 / 1000<br>      </pre>
<p>Notice the last line above that reads <i>Buffer pool hit rate</i>.
It's important to get that rate as close to 100% as possible. For large
databases, however, 95%-99% is the best that can be achieved and
indicates a well tuned system.</p>
<h3>MyISAM Key Buffer</h3>
<p>The MyISAM storage engine uses a key buffer for caching index
data from disk. Actual row data is buffered by the operating system
file cache, and this difference requires another tuning method than for
the InnoDB buffer pool. Because the operating system is caching row
data, some system memory must remain free to cache the row data on
disk. Typically, the key buffer will be set to use up to 50% of the
main memory of a dedicated database using MyISAM as its storage engine
for optimal database performance. It is configured like this:<br>
</p>
<pre>   set-variable = key_buffer = 256M<br>      </pre>
<p>Unlike the InnoDB buffer pool, the MyISAM key buffer will not
pre-allocate itself at MySQL startup, but will instead only be used as
required, so having a high setting for a small database will not do any
harm.</p>
<p>In order to evaluate the performance of the MyISAM key buffer,
you may look at the MySQL status like so:<br>
</p>
<pre>SHOW STATUS LIKE 'key%';<br><br>+------------------------+---------+<br>| Variable_name          | Value   |<br>+------------------------+---------+<br>| Key_blocks_not_flushed | 0       |<br>| Key_blocks_unused      | 229554  |<br>| Key_blocks_used        | 6987    |<br>| Key_read_requests      | 3011875 |<br>| Key_reads              | 6987    |<br>| Key_write_requests     | 1071612 |<br>| Key_writes             | 1071612 |<br>+------------------------+---------+<br>      </pre>
<p>To determine the cache read miss rate, simply divide the <tt>Key_reads</tt>
by the <tt>Key_read_requests</tt>. In this case the cache miss ratio
is 23% which suggests a fairly well tuned database.</p>
<h3>Mixed Storage Engines</h3>
<p>In the case where the database application will mix the use of
storage engines, both the <tt>innodb_buffer_pool_size</tt> and <tt>key_buffer</tt>
will have to be configured, but keeping in mind the total system
memory, as well as the per process memory limits on the system. With
32-bit systems, the per process limit will usually be 2G memory in
which case care must also be taken not to exceed this total memory
allocation for the MySQL database process. One must also factor in
other settings like the per connection thread memory buffers: <tt>sort_buffer_size</tt>,
<tt>read_rnd_buffer_size</tt>, <tt>read_buffer_size</tt>, and <tt>join_buffer_size</tt>.</p>
<p>A typical usage of mixed storage engines might be InnoDB
tables used to capture data in a transaction safe way, and then batch
copied into MyISAM tables for its <tt>FULLTEXT</tt> search and <tt>RTREE</tt>
spatial search capabilities, so this kind of set up is not uncommon.</p>
<h3>32-bit vs. 64-bit Hardware</h3>
<p>On 32-bit platforms, the usual limit for memory allocated to
MySQL is 2GB, so the MyISAM key buffer and InnoDB buffer pool will need
to be configured well below that to allow memory to be allocated for
connecting threads. Even if a system has more than 2GB memory, the
MySQL server process can only use 2GB memory on these systems, and if
its tries to use more memory, it will crash. In the case of MyISAM,
this is not so bad because the operating system is relied upon for
caching access to the data files. Therefore, databases with 4GB or 6GB
memory can be tuned effectively for MyISAM access, even with this 2GB
limit.</p>
<p>On 64-bit platforms, which for x86-64 systems requires both
operating system and hardware support, the per process memory limits
are increased. The InnoDB buffer pool could then be set as high as
128GB, which is not the limit. Also, MyISAM key buffer can be
configured as high as 4GB. This is currently the maximum limit for the <tt>key_buffer</tt>
configuration.</p>
