Dear Team,

                     Till WebNMS 4.7 SP3 for an active webclient development, we provide a tomcat manager tool to developers/customers(direct).
The tool will replace some of our existing tomcat configuration files such as web.xml, mod_jk.conf-auto etc. This is with respect to tomcat 4.

Now in Tomcat 5, they are providing the tool as a link in the tomcat home page with a simple configuration.

The file needed to modified is <WebNMS_HOME>/apache/tomcat/conf/tomcat-users.xml.

The sample entry for the same is

<role rolename="manager"/>
 <user username="jeyaprakash" password="<password>" roles="manager"/>

Further the link access will permitted only for configured users. This is a good functionality. We need to integrate it so that our customers will be benefited.

Thanks and Regards
Jeyaprakash
