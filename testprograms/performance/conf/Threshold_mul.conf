  <!--
This is the Thresholds configuration file.
You can specify the initial set of Thresholds using this file.
The ThresholdObjects can be created using this conf and this 
threshold objects can be associated with the OIDs to be polled
using the Polling.conf
These Threshold Objects are the basic units for generating the
Threshold Events i.e. Events when the value obtained during 
polling is not in the specified range.
Any number of Threshold Objects can be associated with one OID and
one Threhold Object can be associated with any OID.

The fields of the threshold object are explained below


         name  - The name of the thresholdObject. Every threshold
                 object is identified by its name ThresholdObject
                 is associated to an oid using its name.


         kind  - The kind of the threshold object. That is whether the
                 the threshold has to be compared against string or a
                 long value or percentage type. Valid values for this 
                 field are "string" or "long" or "percentage".


     severity  - The severity of the threshold object. Please ensure that
                 you specify the severity as an integer.  
                 The mapping between integer and severity can be known from
		 the SeverityInfo.xml in this directory. 
                 This field is aplicable only to threshold objects of kind
                 long and percentage.


     category  - The category of the event to be generated.  This field is
                 applicable to threshold objects of both the kinds - 
                 long and string.  This field is optional, the default
                 category is "Threshold".


thresholdType  - The type of the ThresholdObject (max/min). If the 
                 thresholdType is max, then an event will be fired
                 when the value exceeds the value specified in
                 thresholdValue and viceversa. This field is applicable
                 only to threshold objects of kind long and percentage.


thresholdValue - The threshold value of the threshold object.
                 This field will be a long value for threshold
                 objects of kind long, and percentage for threshold
                 objects of kind percentage.  This field is only
                 applicable to threshold objects of kind long and percentage.


   rearmValue  - The value at which the threshold object is rearmed.
                 Once a ThresholdObject fires an event, it gets disarmed.
                 ThresholdObject is rearmed if the polled value goes below 
                 or above its rearmValue (rearming is based on the 
                 thresholdType - max or min).  
                 Only armed ThresholdObjects can fire events.  This field
                 will be a long value for threshold objects of kind long,
                 and percentage for threshold objects of kind percentage.
                 This field is applicable only to threshold objects of 
                 kind long and percentage.


      message  - The message for the event to be generated. This field is 
                 applicable to threshold objects of all kinds.  This field 
                 is optional, the default value for this field is "Threshold exceeded : ".


   clrMessage  - The message when the previous severity is cleared and
                 an clear event is generated.  This field is applicable 
                 to threshold objects of all kinds.
                 This field is optional, the default value for this field
                 is "Threshold reset : ".


    sendClear  - boolean representing whether a clear event should
                 be sent before changing the severity.  This field is 
                 applicable to threshold objects of kind long and percentage.


      allowed  - The set of strings that are allowed for this threshold object.
                 This field is applicable to threshold objects of kind string.
                 Strings for this field can be delimited with commas (see the
                 example for details).


   disAllowed  - The set of strings that are not allowed for this threshold
                 object. This field is applicable to threshold objects of 
                 kind string. Strings for this field can be delimited with 
                 commas (see the example for details).


triggerSeverity- The severity to be generated for the threshold object
                 of kind string. Please ensure that you specify this
                 field as integer (see the mapping between severity
                 and integer below)


resetSeverity  - The severity to be generated for the threshold object
                 of the kind string, when the previous severity is 
                 cleared. Please ensure that you specify this field as
                 integer (see the mapping between severity and integer below)


           oid - This field is applicable for threshold objects of kind
                 percentage.  This represents the oid from which the 
                 value should be obtained to calculate the percentage.


    oidType    - The type of the oid (ie., whether it is of type 
                 node,interface or multiple).  This field is
                 applicable for threshold objects of type percentage.




BELOW ARE EXAMPLE AS HOW TO SPECIFY THE VALUES FOR EACH KIND THRESHOLD OBJECT.

name as threshold1, severity as Critical, category as Threshold, 
thresholdType as max, thresholdValue as 20000, rearmValue as 18000,

     triggerSeverity="1"
     resetSeverity="5"
