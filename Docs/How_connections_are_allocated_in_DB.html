 style="border-collapse: collapse; font-size: 12px;">The following
describes how connections are allocated in 4.7 SP3<br style=""

<span style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;"><br
 style="" clear="none">
Transactional Connection</span><br style="" clear="none">
<br style="" clear="none">
The Connection Pool in NMS maintains two data structures for holding
the transactional connections namely<br style="" clear="none">
<ul style="">
  <li style="">Free connections array<br style="" clear="none">
  </li>
  <li style="">Currently used connections mapping (Thread Vs connection
mapping ) (Hashtable)<br style="" clear="none">
  </li>
</ul>
When NMS starts, it would create transactional connections as
configured and store the same in the free connections array.<br style=""
 clear="none">
<br style="" clear="none">
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">What happens when a thread
tries to execute queries in transaction mode :</span><br style=""
 clear="none">
<ul style="">
  <li style="">Whenever a thread begins a transaction, the Connection
Pool moves a connection from the free connection array to the currently
used array and it would be mapped to that particular thread.<span
 class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span><br style="" clear="none">
  </li>
  <li style="">The database queries performed by that particular thread
are executed through the connection mapped with the thread<br style=""
 clear="none">
  </li>
  <li style="">Once a commit or rollback occurs in that particular
thread, the ConnectionPool is notified of the same and it would remove
the respective connection from the currently used connection to the
free connection array.</li>
  <li style="">In case, a thread begins a transaction with a timeout
value, the<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span><span
 style="font-style: italic;">TransactionAPI</span><span
 class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span>would schedule a<span
 style="font-style: italic;">TransactionTimeoutHandler</span><span
 class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span>with the timeout after the
Connection Pool associates a connection with the thread. If the thread
does not commit before this timeout value, the timeout handler would be
executed and a rollback would happen. Then the Connection Pool would
remove the respective connection from the currently used connection to
the free connection array.</li>
  <li style="">The<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span><span
 style="font-style: italic;">TransactionTimeoutHandler</span><span
 class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span>would be scheduled in all
cases except when the timeout value is set as -1. In such a case, there
would be no time out check.<br style="" clear="none">
  </li>
</ul>
<br style="" clear="none">
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">What happens when a thread
tries to execute queries in transaction mode when all the connections
are currently used :</span><br style="" clear="none">
<br style="" clear="none">
In case all the transaction connections are being used when a new
thread begins a transaction, the Connection Pool would would wait until
a connection is available in the free connection array and then map the
same with the thread. The Connection Pool would check the free
connection array every second until it crosses its timeout value. In
case it is not able to fetch a connection within the timeout value, an
exception stating that Free connection is not available would be thrown.<span
 class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span><br style="" clear="none">
Please note, if the timeout is set as -1, the Connection Pool would
indefinitely check the free connection array until it gets one.<br
 style="" clear="none">
<span style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;"><br
 style="" clear="none">
Non Transactional Connection<br style="" clear="none">
</span><span style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;"><br
 style="" clear="none">
</span>The Connection Pool in NMS maintains a single array for holding
the non transaction connections. It also maintains a tracker to keep
track of the last connection given. The tracker's value fall within the
range of the non transactional connections i.e if there are 2 non
transactional connection its values would be 0,1.<span
 class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span><br style="" clear="none">
<br style="" clear="none">
Whenever a thread requests for a connection, the tracker increments it
value and return the non transactional connection present at that index
in the connection array. When the tracker's value crosses the max
value, it would be reset to its initial value.<span
 class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span><br style="" clear="none">
For example, assume there are 2 non transactional connections (c1, c2)
and 3 threads (t1, t2, t3) tries to obtain connections simultaneously.
Then thread t1 would get connection c1 , t2 would get c2 and t3 would
get c1.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span><br style=""
 clear="none">
As of now, there is no provision to lock the connection if it is used
by another thread. The locking of connections was avoided as
simultaneous execution of queries through a common connection by
different threads is handled by the JDBC implementation. And hence
there would not be any issues of data corruption.<br style=""
 clear="none">
<span style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;"><br
 style="" clear="none">
<br style="" clear="none">
Handling Non transactional connection similar to Transactional
connections</span><br style="" clear="none">
<br style="" clear="none">
The locking of transaction connections has been implemented as the
Connection Pool would be notified whenever the usage of a transactional
connection starts and stops i.e through the begin and commit mechanisms.<span
 class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span><br style="" clear="none">
However such a provision does not exist for non transactional
connections. A module would request a connection and execute queries
using the same. However it would not send any notification to the
Connection Pool after using the same. Hence the Connection Pool would
never know if the module/ thread has used the connection or not.<br
