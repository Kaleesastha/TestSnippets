The following describes how connections are allocated in 4.7 SP3<br
 clear="none">
<span style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;"><br
 clear="none">
Transactional Connection</span><br clear="none">
<br clear="none">
The Connection Pool in NMS maintains two data structures for holding
the transactional connections namely<br clear="none">
<ul>
  <li> Free connections array<br clear="none">
  </li>
  <li>Currently used connections mapping (Thread Vs connection mapping
) (Hashtable)<br clear="none">
  </li>
</ul>
When NMS starts, it would create transactional connections as
configured and store the same in the free connections array.<br
 clear="none">
<br clear="none">
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">What happens when a thread
tries to execute queries in transaction mode :</span><br clear="none">
<ul>
  <li>Whenever a thread begins a transaction, the Connection Pool moves
a connection from the free connection array to the currently used array
and it would be mapped to that particular thread. <br clear="none">
  </li>
  <li>The database queries performed by that particular thread are
executed through the connection mapped with the thread<br clear="none">
  </li>
  <li>Once a commit or rollback occurs in that particular thread, the
ConnectionPool is notified of the same and it would remove the
respective connection from the currently used connection to the free
connection array.</li>
  <li>In case, a thread begins a transaction with a timeout value, the <span
 style="font-style: italic;">TransactionAPI</span> would schedule a <span
 style="font-style: italic;">TransactionTimeoutHandler</span> with the
timeout after the Connection Pool associates a connection with the
thread. If the thread does not commit before this timeout value, the
timeout handler would be executed and a rollback would happen. Then the
Connection Pool would remove the respective connection from the
currently used connection to the free connection array.</li>
  <li>The <span style="font-style: italic;">TransactionTimeoutHandler</span>
would be scheduled in all cases except when the timeout value is set as
-1. In such a case, there would be no time out check.<br clear="none">
  </li>
</ul>
<br clear="none">
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">What happens when a thread
tries to execute queries in transaction mode when all the connections
are currently used :</span><br clear="none">
<br clear="none">
In case all the transaction connections are being used when a new
thread begins a transaction, the Connection Pool would would wait until
a connection is available in the free connection array and then map the
same with the thread. The Connection Pool would check the free
connection array every second until it crosses its timeout value. In
case it is not able to fetch a connection within the timeout value, an
exception stating that Free connection is not available would be
thrown. <br clear="none">
Please note, if the timeout is set as -1, the Connection Pool would
indefinitely check the free connection array until it gets one.<br
 clear="none">
<span style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;"><br
 clear="none">
Non Transactional Connection<br clear="none">
</span><span style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;"><br
 clear="none">
</span>The Connection Pool in NMS maintains a single array for holding
the non transaction connections. It also maintains a tracker to keep
track of the last connection given. The tracker's value fall within the
range of the non transactional connections i.e if there are 2 non
transactional connection its values would be 0,1. <br clear="none">
<br clear="none">
Whenever a thread requests for a connection, the tracker increments it
value and return the non transactional connection present at that index
in the connection array. When the tracker's value crosses the max
value, it would be reset to its initial value. <br clear="none">
For example, assume there are 2 non transactional connections (c1, c2)
and 3 threads (t1, t2, t3) tries to obtain connections simultaneously.
Then thread t1 would get connection c1 , t2 would get c2 and t3 would
get c1. <br clear="none">
As of now, there is no provision to lock the connection if it is used
by another thread. The locking of connections was avoided as
simultaneous execution of queries through a common connection by
different threads is handled by the JDBC implementation. And hence
there would not be any issues of data corruption.<br clear="none">
<span style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;"><br
 clear="none">
Handling Non transactional connection similar to Transactional
connections</span><br clear="none">
<br clear="none">
The locking of transaction connections has been implemented as the
Connection Pool would be notified whenever the usage of a transactional
connection starts and stops i.e through the begin and commit
mechanisms. <br clear="none">
However such a provision does not exist for non transactional
connections. A module would request a connection and execute queries
using the same. However it would not send any notification to the
Connection Pool after using the same. Hence the Connection Pool would
never know if the module/ thread has used the connection or not.<br
 clear="none">
<br clear="none">
In order to implement locking of the non transaction connections, it
would be necessary for the threads that request the connection to
return the connection to the Connection Pool after using the same. This
would help the Connection Pool in identifying the free and used non
transactional connections. However the proposed implementation involves
2 major changes as follows :<br clear="none">
<ul>
  <li>A major change of NMS modules so as to fetch a connection
whenever it is required and return the same after using it. <br
 clear="none">
  </li>
  <li>Modification of existing customer code so as to return the
connection after using the same.<br clear="none">
  </li>
</ul>
<span style="color: rgb(220, 20, 60);">We feel that the locking of non
transactional connections would be an overkill and the performance gain
achieved would be minimal when compared to the mammoth effort involved
in implementing the same. Please let us know your views on the same.</span><br
