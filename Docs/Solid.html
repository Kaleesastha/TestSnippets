Dear Vishnu<u1:p> </u1:p><br>
<p class="MsoPlainText"><font color="blue" face="Tahoma" size="2"><span
 style="font-size: 10pt;">Thanks for providing us the database. We have
successfully installed it &amp; connected to
it. Now we have some issues when installing it as a
service. I have attached an image Solid_err.JPG, which I got when I
tried to
install the Solid service. Also, there was no details in EventLogs.<u1:p>
</u1:p>Kindly do help in installing Solid Service.<u1:p></u1:p><o:p></o:p></span></font></p>

<p class="MsoPlainText"><font color="blue" face="Tahoma" size="2"><span
 style="font-size: 10pt;">Do you have a license file? (solid.lic)<u1:p></u1:p><br>
If yes, here is what we do to install solid as a
windows service:<u1:p></u1:p><o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText"><b><font color="red" face="Tahoma" size="2"><span
 style="font-size: 10pt; color: red; font-weight: bold;">D:\CVS\framework\db\bin\solid.exe
-sinstall,"ConSentry InSight Database",
D:\CVS\framework\db\bin\solid.exe,autostart</span></font></b><font
 color="blue" face="Tahoma" size="2"><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><u1:p></u1:p><o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText"><font color="blue" face="Tahoma" size="2"><span
 style="font-size: 10pt;">We call the above command from
D:\CVS\framework\db\data directory. This takes care of 2 things. One,
the
solid.lic file is present in this directory. Two, when solid gets
installed as
a windows service, it executes in this directory making sure the
license file
is found.<u1:p></u1:p><o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText"><font color="blue" face="Tahoma" size="2"><span
 style="font-size: 10pt;">If you open the services window and right
click on
solid service (ConSentry InSight Database), and select Properties, a
window
will pop up. Under the general tab, there is a non editable text field
called
"Path to executable". Here is what it reads like for us after we do
the above step:<u1:p></u1:p><o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText"><b><font color="red" face="Tahoma" size="2"><span
 style="font-size: 10pt; color: red; font-weight: bold;">D:\CVS\framework\db\bin\solid.exe
-c "D:\CVS\framework\db\data" -n "ConSentry InSight
Database" -s start<br>
Rubal.<u1:p></u1:p></span></font></b><o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText"><font color="blue" face="Tahoma" size="2"><span
 style="font-size: 10pt;"><u1:p>&nbsp;Vishnu is right. What we do is
that once solid is installed as a windows service, we run solid.exe to
create an empty database (.db files) and<br>
then run solid as a windows service. Here is the command we execute
from D:\CVS\framework\db\data directory to create an empty database.<br>
..\bin\solid.exe -C &lt;Database Name&gt; -U &lt;Username&gt; -P
&lt;Password&gt;<br>
Hope this helps.<br>

Hi Venkat,<br>
<br>
You have the solid.lic file in the dir C:\Solid\DatabaseEngine4.1 Does
this directory have a existing solid database file in it. When starting
SOLID as a service it is required that there needs to be a DB file
existing in the directory to which the -c option points to. If the DB
file is present and you still cannot start SOLID as a service then
browsing the solmsg.out and solerror.out will give you info as to the
possible reasons.<br>
regards<br>

Dear Rubal<br>
Thanks for your response.<br>
I have got the following directory structure:
C:\Solid\DatabaseEngine4.1\bin<br>
Solid.lic is present in C:\Solid\DatabaseEngine4.1\solid.lic. The
procedure I used to install the Solid Database service is to execute
the following command from C:\Solid\DatabaseEngine4.1 (i.e)
C:\Solid\DatabaseEngine4.1&gt; C:\Solid\DatabaseEngine4.1\bin\solid.exe
-sinstall,"SOLID41", C:\Solid\DatabaseEngine4.1\bin\solid.exe,autostart
<br>
<br>
I could see the following command (in the path to executable) on
clicking the properties of the Solid service
C:\Solid\DatabaseEngine4.1\bin\solid.exe -c
"C:\Solid\DatabaseEngine4.1" -n "SOLID41" -s start<br>
<br>
But when I started the service the same error dialog (which I reported
yesterday) thrown up. Also I could start the Solid as a standalone
process as prescribed (i.e) bin\solid -c eval_kit\standalone From
C:\Solid\DatabaseEngine4.1\ as C:\Solid\DatabaseEngine4.1&gt; bin\solid
-c eval_kit\standalone<br>
I believe that I have not committed any mistake in using the double
quotes.<br>
Kindly guide me.<br>
Thanks &amp; regards<br>

Check the license file again (maybe it has expired) or make sure you
are giving the same commands as I have given below (in the image you
sent<br>
yesterday, I had noticed that the double quotes may have been wrongly
placed).<br>
<br>
I have no idea why it isn't working for you. You have asked for help
and I would be glad to provide it, but tell me how. <br>
